<p>Tree or dinosaur? Dinosaur, we say! This dinosaur hangs around the park most of the year and appears to turn into a skeleton during Autumn.</p>

<h4>Sunday 1 May 2022 Taken by park photographer Tim Allen</h4>
<p>Here come the sceptics. &quot;That could be any animal's egg&quot;. Guess what, dinosaurs are a part of any animals. We conducted a test to determine the species of this egg. We heated it in water to a boiling point for several minutes, peeled the egg and our dinosaur expert tasted it. Dinosaur.</p>

        <p>Safari Man founded this park in 2002 following his controversial claims of dinosaur sightings in the Americas during the late 1980s. In hopes of starting fresh in the Southern Hemisphere, he bought a plot of land here in Canberra and transformed it into Dinosaur Park. </p>
